               What's up everyone! 
               <br>
               <br>
               <p>My name is Mariana, but I sometimes go by Mo. I am a foruth year Anthropology major, with a minor in Digital Humanities (obviously). I am a Lemelson scholar!
               I just wrapped up a research project I began working on in the Winter of 2021 regarding the types of narratives constructed around fast-food items in English and in Spanish.
               I also work as Peer Learning Facilitator for Anthropology with the Academic Advacnement Program here at UCLA, and I've been doing this since the Fall of 2020.</p>
               <p>I was born in Pomona, CA and grew up in Ontario, CA. Now I live in Westwood, but I am planning to return back home after graduation.</p>
               <p>One of my main goals in this course is to get comfortable coding. I have experience with Markdown and R, but I have only ever pasted
                   codes from my professors.
               </p>
               <p>Some of my favorite hobbies include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Going to the Gym</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I started going in the Spring of 2020.</li>
                            <li>I do not go consistently, and I still consider myself a beginner.</li>
                            <li>I like trying new exercises & visiting different gyms!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Trying different coffee shops with my friends. Some of my favorites so far include:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>Groundwork Coffee Co.</i></li>
                            <li><i>La Monarca Bakery & Cafe</i></li>
                            <li><i>Ministry of Coffee</i></li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
